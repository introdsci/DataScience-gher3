## Abstract

So far in the project, I have look at the data and have done the first phase out of the 3. I have discovered which dataset I am going to used for the project and wrote an introduction to why I chose this dataset. I then clean and analyze the data to get insights on what topics I will like to investigate with the dataset.

### 1. Discovery and Data Preparation

First deliverable is to clean and analyze the dataset to explore possible insights on how to answers research questions later in the phases. [link to deliverable1](deliverable1.html)

### 2. Model Planning and Building

Coming soon...

### 3. Results and Operationalization

Coming soon...
